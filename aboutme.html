	<p>Hi, I am Shanshan Tian. I am originally from China, but currently study in the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign majoring in Computer Science.
	I attended high school in China, and before that I lived in Finland for 15 years so I can speak English, Chinese and Finnish.
	During my free time I enjoy playing the piano or hanging out with friends.</p>
	
	<p>I am looking forward to the four years ahead of me at UIUC, and I look forward to making lots of new friends.</p>
	
	<p>	Take a second to look at my <a href="assets/Resume-FirstnameLastname.pdf">r�sum�</a>!</p>
